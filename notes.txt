README:


"
"Not the Language I would use, doesnt necessarily say what this App even does. the name very real serving app sounds like a scam.
Does not explain or give high level of what app.py does. One would have to go into app.py and figure out what is occuring to get a sense of 
purpose.

Does not specify you need to download docker. I dont have it.

requirements.txt
"Sometimes its best to add the version of the dependencies needed"

app.py

" FILE_SECRET is just hard coded for all to see. If this was a admin password or a shared API key, it would have to be erased and recreated.

For my liking, this python script has no comments, I believe in documenting information to make it clear what my thoughts, intentions were/are in a certain block of code, function or task.

if you run the code exactly as the readme suggests:
KeyError: 'APP_PORT'

No documentation that you need to add ENV-VAR for this APP_PORT based on Docker.

Could not figure out what that X-Image-Secret was... I understand what its for, but not how to make it work without sending a request with that header with Postman or something.

I deviced to just "check" the user based on the credentials they provided. Probably not the best solution, but it got the app working.

With that in mind, it was also missing a "home page" and directions on what the app has/is capable of.

I am also unsure
